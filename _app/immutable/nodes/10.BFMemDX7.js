            Husain Rahim came from a Gujarati Hindu family (his birth name was Chagan Khiraj Varma) and came to Canada
            as a tourist in 1910. Five months after his arrival, the immigration
            department started the procedure for deportation against him.
            However, Rahim fought the case and won it in court thereby,
            remaining in Vancouver.
            <br /><br />
            In 1911, Rahim established the United India League, an organization focused
            on employing constitutional methods to stimulate social and political
            renewal within the Hindustanee populace.
            <br /><br />
            In 1914 when the Komagata Maru incident occurred, Rahim was an active
            member of the local shore communities and played a prominent role in
            helping the ship's passengers. He, along with other members, raised some
            $22k to purchase the ship and find a way to evade Canadian policy. Unfortunately,
            while that did not work, his inspiring efforts to fight the discriminatory
            policies then has been forgotten by many.
            <br /><br />

            Aside from this, he lived in Kobe, Japan for 15 years where he was
            known as, "Shagan Lall". He was also the editor for "The Hindustanee
            Newspaper", which was mainly read by the South Asian community
            residing in Vancouver and the lower mainland at the time. He owned a
            bookstore near Strawberry Hill, and is noted to be the first East
            Indian who married in Canada.
            <br /><br />

            A commemorative plaque in Husain Rahim's name is located under the
            Cambie Bridge. Alongside Harnam Kaur Plaza and Khalsa Diwan Road,
            these memorial projects, undertaken by The Nameless Collective in
            collaboration with the City of Vancouver, aim to incorporate Punjabi
            and South Asian history into the cityscape. The plaque's
            inscription, crafted by Paneet Singh, honors Rahim's contributions.

        `},{img:"",name:"Barkatullah",years:"(1858-1927)",desc:` Barkatullah was one of the muslims on the Komagata Maru ship.
        Born in Bhopal, Barkatullah received his early education in a Madressah
        where he learnt "Arabic, Persian and other religious sciences". 
        Early on in his life, he was inspired by the anti imperialist
        campaign of Syed Jamaluddin Afghani.
        <br><br>

        After completing his education, he moved to London where he taught Arabic
        for 8 years. His criticism of British imperial policies did not bode well
        with the British government and he decided to migrate to the USA, where he
        actively participated in Ghaddar Party activities. Like many other revolutionary
        figures of the early twentieth century, Barkatullah traveled extensively
        across Central Asia, Russia, and Europe throughout his life to seek international
        solidarity and support for India's freedom. He was in Tokyo in 1914 when
        he heard about the sailing of the Komagata Maru ship and decided to board
        it.

      `},{img:"",name:"Dan Ali Muhammad",years:"-",desc:`Dan Ali Muhammad was the great grandfather of Khalad, a member of the Abbotsford Islamic Centre. Dan came to BC in 1906, even before the Komagata Maru incident. He traveled from India to Tacoma to Duncan in Vancouver Island, and then to Port Alberni and Boston Bar. He worked in the timber industry, logging, and sawmills. Being the only Muslim person living in Duncan at that time, he was involved in raising funds for a Gurdwara to be built there, as it was the only form of connection he had to the community. At the Duncan Gurdwara, his name is commemorated in the main building as a contributor. An interesting point to note is that when the first Islamic Centre was to be built in Vancouver, the Sikhs living there also contributed money towards the funds for construction.
        <br><br>
        As a typical form of migration, families from Boston Bar would move towards the Hope/Chilliwack/Abbotsford area, as did Dan Ali Mohammed. Khalad's grandfather came to Boston Bar sometime in the late 1940s as a young child from India while his great-grandfather was still in Port Alberni. As he grew older, he too worked in sawmills.
        <br><br>
        Due to the policies set by the Canadian government, South Asian migrants had to typically travel back and forth for getting married and having children.
        <br><br>
        Khalad's mother was born in Pakistan and came to BC after her marriage. She worked in a government-run nursery in the mountains in North Bend at Boston Bar.`},{img:"",name:"Roum Shah",years:"-",desc:`

            newspaper clipping from the April 23, 1914 issue of The Sun
            indicates that Roum Shah was the co-author of a pamphlet, “The
            Tyranny of the English Militarism.” He wrote this pamphlet to
            protest the forceful deportation of a prominent Ghaddar Party
            member, Bhagwan Singh, from Vancouver/Victoria to Hong Kong.

        or not someone who came from South Asia to BC was a Muslim was by
        assessing whether or not their name was a Muslim one. This name could be
        mentioned in one of the many primary documents our researchers went
        through. These included newspapers, meeting minutes or autobiographies.
        Some of these traces or names found in newspapers give us just a brief
        glimpse into what like was like for South Asian Canadian Muslims in BC at the
        time. For instance, this ad from 1912 tells us that a man with a Muslim
        name had set up shop giving herbal remedies for multiple ailments and
        was advertising his herbs as being “Indian” and, therefore, “noted
        throughout the British Empire for being superior to drugs for many
        diseases.” If his testimonials are anything to go by, he had many happy
        customers around Grenville Street! A small collection of these snippets
        can be read in greater detail in our section on <a>Case Studies: Hidden Histories</a> <br/><br/> <!> In addition to the stories of early Muslim migrants, it is important to
        note the reception they received within Canada. In the 1920s the idea of
        the Ottoman empire as the enemy in the context of WW1 was conflated with
        all Muslims. Scholars who have studied Muslims across the world have
        reminded us that this idea of Muslims as being dangerous and “alien” was
        by no means restricted to one particular area of the centres of Empire
        or what today we refer to as Western democracies. In the 1920s, Muslims
        were portrayed in Canadian newspapers as “fanatics”, the stories told
        about South Asian Canadian Muslims encouraged an exotic conception of the Muslim
        man who was portrayed as specifically being out to “make Christian
        America Mohammedan”. <br/><br/> However, this task was made much more confusing for researchers by the fact
        that some people would take on pseudonyms when they came to Canada. <br/><br/> Such was the case of Husain Rahim, whose real name was Chagan Khairaj Varma.
        Husain Rahim was helping South Asians workers in British Columbia and was
        also a supporter of the anti-colonial movement and party of the time, the
        Ghadr party. As a result, changing his name was a way to keep him safe from
        the colonial police. This did not mean that his change of name kept him safe.
        In fact, Varma (or Rahim if you prefer) was threatened with deportation in
        the 1910s, when Canadian immigration laws were restrictive and explicitly

        different places, mainly because their pasts were connected to Empire
        and Empire was global. In other words, South Asian Canadian Muslims were part of
        a layered migration history which means that their identity is both
        national (connected to countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri
        Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan) as well as Transnational (connected to multiple
        waves of migration that connect them to South Asia, but also connect
        their ancestral story to places in the Carribbean and Africa). Some
        scholars use the term “double diaspora” to refer to communities that
        have experienced multiple migration stages, leading to identities that
        merge influences from different regions. <div class="flex w-full flex-col md:flex-row items-start justify-evenly md:*:w-1/2"><!> <!></div> <br/> Many South Asian Canadian Muslim in British Columbia trace their roots to Punjab,
        Gujarat, Fiji or other parts of South Asia, but their migration to Canada
        did not happen in a linear fashion. For instance, Gujarati Muslims who had
        a long history of being involved in trading networks were a global community.
        Scholars have pointed out how Muslim traders across the Indian Ocean developed
        different ideas of a transnational identity which became more important than
        their country of birth. Many of these links were subsequently disrupted by
        the emergence of European colonialism in the Indian Ocean. In the interviews
        conducted for this project, one of the respondents pointed toward their family
        sharing such an identity rooted in their business and trade links. See <a href="#">X</a> <!> <br/><br/> Simultaneously, other groups of South Asian Canadian Muslims were sent with other
        South Asian workers to British colonies in East Africa like Uganda to work
        on the railways that the British Empire was building. Those who went to Uganda
        would be displaced again in 1972 when Idi Amin expelled Asians from the country
        (see 1972 in <a>Historical Timeline</a>). The
        rise of the use of Asians as indentured workers in colonies closely
        followed the end of abolition of slavery and so these workers were, in
        some cases, replacing African slave labour. The experiences of Fijian
        Muslims was similar, as they arrived in the Pacific as indentured
        laborers under British colonial rule and went on to form tightly knit
        religion and cultural communities before a second wave of migration
        Canda took place in the later 20th century. <br/><br/> <!> These “double diaspora” Muslims came to British Columbia carrying a
        combination of religious, social and cultural traditions that meshed the
        multiple journeys that were part of their life history. So their Islamic
        identity was not just South Asian, but influenced by East African or
        Fijian experiences resulting in unique local expressions of Islam in
        Canada. <br/><br/> Once they arrived in British Columbia, many of these Muslims became part
        of various organizations and associations. Some of these were regionally
        specific while others were organized around a particular Islamic sect.
        These organizations began to appear in BC from the 1960s onward and,
        alongside local mosques provide religious education, marriage services
        and so on. <br/><br/> Muslim identity continues to be both deeply rooted in their local
        practices and yet connected to international events and organizations.
        For instance, conflicts in Palestine, Kashmir or Afghanistan that
        directly influence Muslims deeply impact the local Muslim community
        which organizes to support the global Muslim ummah (or the global
        Islamic community). Religious networks and scholarly exchanges also take
        place. Some of these are more formal, for instance through orgnizations
        like the cosmopolitan Ismaili community while others are more informal
        for instance how young people are exposed to global Islamic discourse
        through their consumption of online information and media. <br/><br/> Global cultural festivals amongst the Muslim community such as Eid
        al-Fitr and Eid al-Azha are celebrated in British Columbia in ways that
        blend South Asian, African and Canadian traditions. <br/><br/> As a result, the South Asian Canadian Muslim experience in British Columbia is
        both national and transnational. Rather than a monolithic “Canadian
        Islam”, what emerges is a pluralistic Muslim identity that negotiates
        between regional traditions, religious doctrines, and what it means to
        be Canadian.</div></section></div></main>`);function Me(C){var h=ke(),r=e(s(h),2),i=s(r),m=e(s(i),2),l=s(m);M(l,{src:"/content/new/1739914074108.jpg",class:"",alt:"Mohammed Yakub, Fijian Muslim living in BC",children:(a,A)=>{o();var t=we();o(),c(a,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var g=e(l,2),p=s(g);M(p,{src:"/content/new/PRG-1373-4-97.jpeg",children:(a,A)=>{o();var t=ye();o(3),c(a,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var w=e(p,2);M(w,{src:"/content/new/Newly_arrived_coolies_in_Trinidad.jpg",alt:"Newly arrived coolies in Trinidad",children:(a,A)=>{o();var t=ve();o(3),c(a,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),n(g);var y=e(g,6);M(y,{class:"md:w-1/2 pt-6",src:"/content/new/ExpSetSittingOnFireRailwayWorkers768x511.jpg",alt:"Ugandan-Asian railway workers during the construction of the Uganda Railway",children:(a,A)=>{o();var t=Ce();o(4),c(a,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var k=e(y,5),v=e(k,5);M(v,{src:"/content/new/2.20.jpg",float:"left",class:"md:w-1/2 pt-6",alt:"Asian refugees from Uganda at Canadian Forces Base",children:(a,A)=>{o();var t=Ae();o(4),c(a,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),o(13),n(m),n(i),n(r),n(h),U(()=>b(k,"href",`${I??""}/history/recent-timeline`)),c(C,h)}var Se=u(`The hate directed at South Asian Canadian Muslims was based on racist

        America’s response to them, forever changed the way that Muslims were
        perceived globally. Scholars like Edward Said have pointed out that
        Muslims came to be seen as a “flattened” category where the diversity of
        cultural and religious practices was erased, particularly in the US.
        Canada’s proximity to the US meant that it was seen as central to the
        response to 9/11 even being specifically mentioned in the US Patriot Act
        under the section “Protecting the Northern Border.” Scholars have argued
        that Canada’s response to 9/11 was affected by the need to appease the
        US so as to keep people and good flowing across the border. In 2001, the
        repercussions of these policies was an increase in racial profiling,
        particularly of Muslim men, who in some very high profile cases became
        the victims of inaccurate information sharing between Canada and the US
        resulting in the torture of these Canadian citizens. The Canadian
        government subsequently conducted a report and apologized for these.
        Nonetheless, the antiterrorism laws, increased border controls and
        deeply problematic representations of Muslims as terrorists after 9/11
        has continued to impact all groups of Canadian Muslims.</div></section> <section><h2>Solidarity with Indigenous Communities</h2> <div>With an increased understanding of how the intertwined histories of
        colonialism, migration, and racism have affected South Asian Canadian
        Muslim communities of B.C, a number of community members have also
        started developing relationships of solidarity and allyship with
        Indigenous communities of B.C. <a href="https://www.islamichistorymonth.ca/indigenous-muslims" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>[*]</sup></a></div></section> <section><h2>Muslim Women</h2> <div>Muslims in British Columbia can choose to be part of a thriving
        community life depending on where they live, which mosques they frequent
        and their own personal choices. <br/><br/> Studies have shown us repeatedly that there is no one typical experience
        for Muslim women across British Columbia. In fact, Muslim women in
        Canada sometimes favour a more “secular” lifestyle (even though their
        skin colour or other markers of identity may prevent this – see section
        on Race and Muslim Identity below). Others want to delve further into
        their identity and culture and there is of course disagreement on the
        “right” way to take these positions as the condition of being human can
        never be uniform.<a href=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> <br/><br/> <!> Women have also actively participated in Muslim associations, although
        it is important to note that they have sometimes had to fight for their
        right to this space. For instance, the Surrey mosque planned by the BCMA
        in 1998 did not have much provision for activities for women and
        children. The design was altered following women’s protests and
        petitions demanding a change.<a href=""><sup>[20]</sup></a> It is also
        important to note that the Muslim sects that have experienced historical
        discrimination, such as the Ahmadi Muslims have been excluded from
        participation in some Muslim associations and spaces and therefore
        Ahmadi Muslim women would have less spaces available to them to
        congregate. <br/><br/> Similarly, younger members of the Muslim community in BC have not always
        agreed with the views of associations choosing to define themselves and
        their relationship to politics differently. In 2004 this produced a
        controversial situation for Itrath Syed, the Muslim candidate for the
        NDP contesting Delta-East Richmond who refused to backdown on her
        position supporting same sex marriage and, as a result, was publicly
        censured by the imam of the Richmond Mosque. <br/><br/> Following this, the most precariously placed groups, may not have the
        same experiences. For instance, research based on interviews with Muslim
        women fleeing domestic violence in Vancouver, BC have found that women
        tend to prioritize finding a home, but give less priority to building
        community and, even when they find safety, feel isolated and like they
        lack community. This points toward the need for having more avenues and
        outlets where people who may be newcomers or find themselves looking for
        new community connections, can build community and connections
        especially Muslim women who are single parents or fleeing domestic
        violence.<a href=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> <br/><br/> It is Muslim men who tend to figure most prominently in accounts of
        racial profiling, Muslim women tend to be seen as an oppressed group in
        need of saving. For instance in an interview conducted by a graduate
        student at UBC of a young Pakistani-Canadian woman who wore a hijab, she
        described an experience she had at school when Kabul, Afghanistan was
        taken over by the US and its allies: <br/><br/> “I remember I was in grade 9 after the coalition forces had taken Kabul,
        I am in the hallway at my locker and this substitute teacher turns to me
        and touches my shoulder and she says: ‘you are free!’ and I was like
        ‘what?!’ and she’s like ‘you are free now, we took Kabul, you are free!’
        and I was like ‘huh?! I was free before!’ (laughs) like what are you
        talking about? But basically what she was saying was like you don’t have
        to wear that anymore because now we have liberated you over there,
        right? So it’s like there is this constant connection, I have nothing to
        do with Afghanistan but she is connecting it. She has picked up my body
        and placed me in that space.” <a href=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> <br/><br/> Faced with situations like these, women have recounted how things like
        community associations, spaces in mosques and the help of neighbours and
        friends has been uplifting. Other Muslim women have spoken about how
        their experiences after 9/11, have meant that the Muslim community began
        to spend more time with one another and gather in community more so as
        to be a source of support for one another.</div></section></div></main>`);function xe(C){var h=_e(),r=e(s(h),2),i=s(r),m=e(s(i),2),l=s(m);M(l,{src:"/content/new/South Asians vulnerable Times Colonist.jpeg",class:"md:w-1/2 md:py-16",alt:"Times Colonist newspaper clipping about South Asians being vulnerable",children:(y,k)=>{o();var v=Se();o(2),c(y,v)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),o(),n(m),n(i);var g=e(i,4),p=e(s(g),2),w=e(s(p),9);M(w,{src:"/content/new/2017.0022.228.07-341.2.JPG",class:"md:w-1/2",alt:"Muslim parade in Surrey",children:(y,k)=>{o();var v=Be();o(),c(y,v)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),o(22),n(p),n(g),n(r),n(h),c(C,h)}var Ie=u(`<main class="py-32 mx-auto flex flex-col gap-10"><h1 class="px-4 lg:px-0 page-title">A Timeline of Muslims in BC <br/> (1900s - present)</h1> <div class="flex flex-col gap-16 history"><section><div>This interactive timeline showcases key events affecting Muslims in
