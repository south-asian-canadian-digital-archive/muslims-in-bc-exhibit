          The hate directed at South Asian Canadian Muslims was based on racist
          assumptions and so it left all visible South Asians vulnerable.

        The attacks on the twin towers on the 11th of September 2011, and
        America’s response to them, forever changed the way that Muslims were
        perceived globally. Scholars like Edward Said have pointed out that
        Muslims came to be seen as a “flattened” category where the diversity of
        cultural and religious practices was erased, particularly in the US.
        Canada’s proximity to the US meant that it was seen as central to the
        response to 9/11 even being specifically mentioned in the US Patriot Act
        under the section “Protecting the Northern Border.” Scholars have argued
        that Canada’s response to 9/11 was affected by the need to appease the
        US so as to keep people and good flowing across the border. In 2001, the
        repercussions of these policies was an increase in racial profiling,
        particularly of Muslim men, who in some very high profile cases became
        the victims of inaccurate information sharing between Canada and the US
        resulting in the torture of these Canadian citizens. The Canadian
        government subsequently conducted a report and apologized for these.
        Nonetheless, the antiterrorism laws, increased border controls and
        deeply problematic representations of Muslims as terrorists after 9/11
        has continued to impact all groups of Canadian Muslims.

      <h2>Solidarity with Indigenous Communities</h2>
      <div>
        With an increased understanding of how the intertwined histories of
        colonialism, migration, and racism have affected South Asian Canadian
        Muslim communities of B.C, a number of community members have also
        started developing relationships of solidarity and allyship with
        Indigenous communities of B.C. <a

      <h2>Muslim Women</h2>
      <div>
        Muslims in British Columbia can choose to be part of a thriving
        community life depending on where they live, which mosques they frequent
        and their own personal choices.

        <br /><br />

        Studies have shown us repeatedly that there is no one typical experience
        for Muslim women across British Columbia. In fact, Muslim women in
        Canada sometimes favour a more “secular” lifestyle (even though their
        skin colour or other markers of identity may prevent this – see section
        on Race and Muslim Identity below). Others want to delve further into
        their identity and culture and there is of course disagreement on the
        “right” way to take these positions as the condition of being human can
        never be uniform.<a href=""><sup>[19]</sup></a>

        <br /><br />

        Women have also actively participated in Muslim associations, although
        it is important to note that they have sometimes had to fight for their
        right to this space. For instance, the Surrey mosque planned by the BCMA
        in 1998 did not have much provision for activities for women and
        children. The design was altered following women’s protests and
        petitions demanding a change.<a href=""><sup>[20]</sup></a> It is also
        important to note that the Muslim sects that have experienced historical
        discrimination, such as the Ahmadi Muslims have been excluded from
        participation in some Muslim associations and spaces and therefore
        Ahmadi Muslim women would have less spaces available to them to
        congregate.

        <br /><br />

        Similarly, younger members of the Muslim community in BC have not always
        agreed with the views of associations choosing to define themselves and
        their relationship to politics differently. In 2004 this produced a
        controversial situation for Itrath Syed, the Muslim candidate for the
        NDP contesting Delta-East Richmond who refused to backdown on her
        position supporting same sex marriage and, as a result, was publicly
        censured by the imam of the Richmond Mosque.

          CBC News. (2002). Members of B.C.'s Muslim community gathered at a
          public hearing in Vancouver to share their experiences and research,
          and talk about what needs to be done to address Islamophobia. In
          cbc.ca. <a

        Following this, the most precariously placed groups, may not have the
        same experiences. For instance, research based on interviews with Muslim
        women fleeing domestic violence in Vancouver, BC have found that women
        tend to prioritize finding a home, but give less priority to building
        community and, even when they find safety, feel isolated and like they
        lack community. This points toward the need for having more avenues and
        outlets where people who may be newcomers or find themselves looking for
        new community connections, can build community and connections
        especially Muslim women who are single parents or fleeing domestic
        violence.<a href=""><sup>[21]</sup></a>

        <br /><br />

        It is Muslim men who tend to figure most prominently in accounts of
        racial profiling, Muslim women tend to be seen as an oppressed group in
        need of saving. For instance in an interview conducted by a graduate
        student at UBC of a young Pakistani-Canadian woman who wore a hijab, she
        described an experience she had at school when Kabul, Afghanistan was
        taken over by the US and its allies:

        <br /><br />

        “I remember I was in grade 9 after the coalition forces had taken Kabul,
        I am in the hallway at my locker and this substitute teacher turns to me
        and touches my shoulder and she says: ‘you are free!’ and I was like
        ‘what?!’ and she’s like ‘you are free now, we took Kabul, you are free!’
        and I was like ‘huh?! I was free before!’ (laughs) like what are you
        talking about? But basically what she was saying was like you don’t have
        to wear that anymore because now we have liberated you over there,
        right? So it’s like there is this constant connection, I have nothing to
        do with Afghanistan but she is connecting it. She has picked up my body
        and placed me in that space.” <a href=""><sup>[22]</sup></a>

        <br /><br />

        Faced with situations like these, women have recounted how things like
        community associations, spaces in mosques and the help of neighbours and
        friends has been uplifting. Other Muslim women have spoken about how
        their experiences after 9/11, have meant that the Muslim community began
        to spend more time with one another and gather in community more so as
        to be a source of support for one another.
